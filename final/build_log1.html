            <h2>Me Builds A House</h2>
            <h3>And Now We Have a House</h3>
            <p>Endermen are known to travel and teleport. They are known to be mysterious. Villagers
                are known to work in their villages, creating a small place of abundance where they can trade. 
                Steve is neither. Steve can raid those villages. Steve can travel across dimensions. Steve can 
                build a home meant for them. That said, Steve is much closer then to an Enderman than a Villager. 
                Thus, Me can be a bit more like Steve. Me can make their own home close enough to the village to feel 
                included but far enough away their world views do not intersect at every glance of the morning.</p>
            <p>The idea itself is simple enough, yet it only dawned upon Me recently after finding a small patch of Cherry Trees. 
                Me loved the pink, a color otherwise rarely seen in the other places they could call home. 
                It was then, two days later, Me arrived back at the village with several stacks of <a href = "https://minecraft.wiki/w/Planks#Cherry" target = "_blank">Cherry Wood, leaves, and sapplings.</a>
                Me then set off on a quest to make good use of this wood, asking the smiths of the village for help occassionally 
                to gather tools to process parts of the wood (a true Steve-like moment, we do say.) As Me excitedly scribbled away, they told us of their plans and reasons for each item, regardless of how bizarre they might be.
                Let's discuss now what they dreamed to do with such tasteful wood.
            </p>
            <h4>Aspirations and Decisions</h4>
            <p>The first question that came to Me was a question of size. Looking at Jeffrey's home, it stands well above the average 
                height for a village house (two stories versus one). Steve had done worse even, creating a tower tall enough to speak with the clouds.
                It would be odd then for Me to only have a one-story home, and thus we retrieved more paper. A two-story home's planning began!
            </p>
            <p>Then, of course, came the defenses and decorations. Me likes their personal space, and thus opted to host a nice fence around their home, letting their 
                friends stay well into the night if needed without fear of unwanted visitors for they would be trapped at the gates. 
                Me also heard of a "back yard" from the Trader once, and thus it was planned for as well. If we have a yard, we might as well have a 
                patio. As Steve once put, Me's visions fit will with a "suburb." Then stood in dreams a cherry, two-story home 
                with a quiet porch, grassy land to fill with flowers, and space for whatever the back yard will be.
            </p>
            <p>Then, Me turned to look inward. It was here we noticed a crucial mistep: the interior was smaller than we perceived! A careful lesson then, 
                to plan size by interior if one wishes to host a planned one. Each side was missing a row's worth of space, and, although not catasrophic, does mean 
                Me has a higher chance of hitting their tall head and some features would have to be pushed to additional floors.
            </p>
            <p>Now then stood four floors: the first floor, the second floor, the attic/roof, and the basement. Fortunately, Steve did have 
                such floors in past projects, so we had some linkling of how to navigate the hidden space an extra two uncounted floors provide. The basement would be 
                a place for crafting, where the chests lie with ores and tools. The attic would be a place to craft with an air of mystery, housing an <a href = "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enchanting_Table" target = "_blank">enchanting table</a>to 
                upgrade the crafts in the basement. The second floor would give an air of privacy, fitting the main bedroom, related work stations, and Me's attempt at an "organic carpet". The living room, as Me 
                giggled, would serve as a "cute" place for us friends to me, hosting a table, some pictures and plants, a small kitchen able to handle 
                Shawn's appetite, and another attempt at the carpet in case the other is messy--all while surrounded by the light of the outdoors and a few reasons to nap 
                on the patio bench.
            </p>

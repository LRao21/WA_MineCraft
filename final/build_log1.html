            <h2>Me Builds A House</h2>
            <h3>And Now We Have a House</h3>
            <p>Endermen are known to travel and teleport. They are known to be mysterious. Villagers
                are known to work in their villages, creating a small place of abundance where they can trade. 
                Steve is neither. Steve can raid those villages. Steve can travel across dimensions. Steve can 
                build a home meant for them. That said, Steve is much closer then to an Enderman than a Villager. 
                Thus, Me can be a bit more like Steve. Me can make their own home close enough to the village to feel 
                included but far enough away their world views do not intersect at every glance of the morning.</p>
            <p>The idea itself is simple enough, yet it only dawned upon Me recently after finding a small patch of Cherry Trees. 
                Me loved the pink, a color otherwise rarely seen in the other places they could call home. 
                It was then, two days later, Me arrived back at the village with several stacks of Cherry Wood, leaves, and sapplings.
                Me then set off on a quest to make good use of this wood, asking the smiths of the village for help occassionally 
                to gather tools to process parts of the wood (a true Steve-like moment, we do say.)
            </p>

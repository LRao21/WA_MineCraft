<h4>Group 1: Exploring Exterior Design Elements in Popular Minecraft Builds</h4>
			<p>The “Exploring Exterior Design Elements” group involves snippets from experiences 
				designing the exteriors of builds. Particularly, they focus on specific design elements, 
				such as window and roof design, instead of the larger scale of builds. Details lie in 
				thought, and that is something we wish to explore through crossroads. To elaborate, 
				the current snippets are drawing of the roof from the “Wooden House” from the Minecraft 
				Handbooks (in comparison to the Pitched Roof style in reality), the window design from 
				the mountainous palace built by FyreUK (in comparison to the window designs and opening 
				styles in reality), and an outline of one of our team member's favorite village 
				structures: the Desert Biome Blacksmith House. Combined, these images represent design 
				choices others—players and Mojang alike—made in world planning, highlighting the 
				significance of small decisions in overall builds.

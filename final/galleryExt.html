			</div>
			<p>The <em>“Exploring Exterior Design Elements”</em> group involves snippets from experiences 
				designing the exteriors of builds. Particularly, they focus on specific design elements, 
				such as window and roof design, instead of the larger scale of builds. Details lie in 
				thought, and that is something we wish to explore through crossroads. </p>
			<p>To elaborate, the current snippets are drawing of the roof from <a href = "https://archive.org/details/MCCSNHandbook/page/n11/mode/2up" target = "_blank">the “Wooden House” from the Minecraft 
				Handbooks</a>, the window design from 
				<a href = "https://archive.org/details/MCCSNHandbook/page/n25/mode/2up" target = "_blank">the mountainous palace built by FyreUK</a>, 
				and an outline of one of our team member's favorite village 
				structures:<a href = "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Village/Structure/Blueprints/Desert_weaponsmith_1_blueprint" target = "_blank">the Desert Biome Weaponsmith House.</a>
				Combined, these images represent design 
				choices others—players and Mojang alike—made in world planning, highlighting the 
				significance of small decisions in overall builds.

				<div class="gallery-item">
					<img src = "images/roof_drawing.png" alt = "Drawing of Roof from Wooden House">
					<p>Roof of the Classic "Wooden House" from the Minecraft Handbooks</p>
				</div>
				<p>The roof of the Wooden House is comparable to <a href = "https://vertix.systems/roof-types-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-the-best-roofing-option/" target = "_blank">Hip Roofs</a>, a style of roofing
					characterized by sloped sides forming ridges, allowing for details like overhangs. Given that climate plays a role in 
					real-world architecture, the design aids in wind resistance, water drainage, and spacing (Vertex Systems, "Roof Types: Ultimate Guide to Choosing the Best Roofing Option"). Although that provides 
					an additional need for proper ariflow so that extra space is properly ventilated, those requirements aren't applicable to Minecraft servers,
					making their asthetics a valuable point instead. Stairs (here, oak wood stairs) can be used to make roofs by stacking them as 
					one would for a staircase, creating an attic space. The adjustments developed into the stairs also allows for that overhang bit in the 
					house's roof, putting attention on the front entrance. So long as it is sealed, the house has an attic space and a simple yet 
					clean roof.

				<div class="gallery-item">
					<img src = "images/windows.png" alt = "Drawing of Windows from Palace build by FyreUK">
					<p>Window From The "Palace Gardens" Build by FyreUK</p>
				</div>
				<p>While real-world builds can host a variety of <a href = "https://www.everest.co.uk/windows/types-of-windows/" target = "_blank">window designs</a> based on
				their styles of movement, Minecraft windows, like in this build are static, leaving the design to show in the decoration of the windows.
				Players sometimes decorate their windows with stairs, trap doors, fences, etc. to give the feeling of ledges and other decorations. Plass panes
				can also be used instead of glass blocks to give a sense of depth. Here, stairs, panes, and trap doors are used to enhance depth while also 
				making the windows stand out against the rest of the build by creating an outline around them noticeable as a window instead of a different external element.</p>
				<div class="gallery-item">
					<img src = "images/blacksmith_house.png" alt = "Drawing of Desert Blacksmith House">
					<p>Layout of the Desert Weaponsmith Village House</p>
				</div>
				<p>Mojang has many pre-designed in-game structures that enhance the user experience by providing 
					resources and lore, among other things. An example of this is their villages, adapting their designs to match biome features.
					Unlike the other physical constraints in minecraft, climate does technically play a role here, with desert buildings, for example,
					looking different from their plains counterparts because of the resources in their respective biomes. 
					The <a href = "https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Village/Structure/Blueprints#Weaponsmith_1_2" target = "_blank">Weaponsmith's House</a>
					is of particular intrigue because of their normally more advanced loot (rarer items compared to other structures in the village), trade possibilties, 
					and uniqueness among the others structures. For example, fitting with the Weaponsmith's role in the village,
					they house has a built in furnace and lava area rather than normal lodging like a bed. Specific to the desert biome is its use of sandstone 
					in villages. Whereas other biomes' villages use the available wood around them, desert villages tend to 
					use more stone-based materials, matching the lack of forest in the biome.

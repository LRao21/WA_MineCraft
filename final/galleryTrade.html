<h4>Group 4: Trades From Our Discussions With The Wandering Trader</h4>
			<p>In addition to our own adventures, our collection would be incomplete without the contributions of our dear friend,
				the Wandering Villager. The “Trades From Our Discussions With The Wandering Trader” group involves snippets of 
				interesting items the trader showed us during our long talks. To ellaborate, these snippets, from the trader's vast options of items,
				are those that Me was excited to see or Jeffrey thought was a beautiful addition to their library. Importantly,
				they all told us much about the worlds they came from, often biomes far away for the entire team to travel.
				Those snippets, are a Lily Pad, a pink Tulip, and pumpkin seeds. Although miniscule in the grand scheme of things,
				they tell us about the swamps in the distance that Me cannot reach because of the water, the quiet fields where the flowers bloom and the mountains 
				other varieties whisper in, and the variety of foods other villages prouce different from our carrots, beets, and potatoes.

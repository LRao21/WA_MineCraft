			<h2>Walking Through Your First Experimentation</h2>
			<p>The <a href = "3D.html">Experiment Page</a>is mean to let creators map out floor plans for their builders, giving them
				an idea of the outcome before they start building while also making it easier to adjust plans
				as the grid provides a dynamic display. This page is designed to give you an understanding of the controls 
                of the Experiment Page. Specificially, we'll walk you through the stage indicators, functionalities, and file capabilties 
                that are essential to using the page.
				</p>
            <h3>First, let's go over the meanings of different colors:</h3>
            <img src = "images/colors.png" style = "height:200px; width:200px;">
            <p> White -> "Unactivated", equivalent to a surface not built on<br>
			    Red -> "Activated", assigned as planned to be part of something<br>
				Blue -> Determined to be part of group ready to be made into a build<br>
				Purple -> Part of a build/structure
			</p>
			<h3>Second, let's go over some general controls: </h3>
            <p>
				1 -> Clicking on a square activates and deactivates them. When a square is red, it means its "activiated",
				incidating an intention for it to be part of a build. When a square is white, it means it is "inactive". <br>
				<img src = "images/click_example.png" style = "height:300px; width:500px;"> <br><br>
				2 -> You can hold your mouse down and hover over squares to quickly activate a number of squares instead of
				clicking each one. They all will turn red! <br>
				<img src = "images/multiple_example.png" style = "height:300px; width:500px;"> <br><br>
				3 -> Double clicking on any square will result in it turning blue. Neighoring/adjacent red cells and purple
				cells will turn blue as well (excluding diagonals, thus the covered area resembles a cross rather than a full 3x3 square). A message will appear indicating that the "group" is prepped for build creation.<br>
				<img src = "images/blue_example.png" style = "height:300px; width:500px;"> <br><br>
				4 -> To "create a build", hover over the "Create A Build" button and enter the build's title and build type (preferably one from the dropdown). Any blue 
				on the grid will turn to purple, indicating they are a part of the same build. The name will also be saved in the filepath section of the page,
                making it easier to track which builds have been added. It is best to build a portion
				at a time and then create a build, as otherwise multiple builds might be counted as one accidentally.<br>
				<img src = "images/build_example.png" style = "height:300px; width:500px;"> <br><br>
				5 -> You can reset the grid to a blank state with the "Reset Grid to Blank" button. All builds will be erased.<br>
				6 -> You can undo an action with the "Remove Most Recent Change" button. Every time you change the state of a square on the grid,
				a new state is saved. Up to ten prior states are saved. Keep clicking the button until you reach the desired past state.<br>
            </p>
            <h3>Now, let's talk build saving:</h3>
            <p>You can save your build files as a json file by clicking the 
                download link below the build path on the page. <br>
                Similarly, you can also reupload a prior build by clicking the upload page. Once you are done,
                you can redownload the page as a new json file. <br> <br>
                If you want to view the builds without risking editing, head over to the map page and upload your file!
            </p>
            <h3>Some Tips:</h3>
            <p>
				Use the space to get an idea of what you want to do. Leave the details for later.<br>
				Use simple measures to make conversions easier later.<br>
				Label as you go so you know what everything should be!<br>
				Use this space to get a general layout of what you want to build. You can always add to your
				designs on paper. The creative process is limitless! <br>

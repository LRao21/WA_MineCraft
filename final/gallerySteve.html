			<p> The <em>“Exploring Remnants of Interactions With Steve”</em>group involves snippets from Me's experiences 
				tracking Steve, learning about their build style and how to incorporate liked elements of their 
				work into their own. Particularly, they focus on peculiar elements 
				in Steve's most recent lodging (and thus Me's most recent expedition.)  </p>
			<p>To ellaborate, the current snippets are drawings of a corner of Steve's home where we believe they kept supplies,
				another corner with what we have found to have been referred to as a "closet", and of a nearby tower that may have
				been used to scout out dangers from afar. Me chose these specific snippets because the items in them-the "carpet", "armor stand",
				and the grand height of the tower-are unfamilar. Most of the crafts in this world are of much shorter height unless a mountain,
				and most of the blocks in them are not designed to hold clothing or cover the floors. Yet, Steve knows of them, and Me 
				plans to experiment with them in future builds.

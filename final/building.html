			<h1> Building With Me!</h1>
			<p> No matter what angle you look at in our village, you'll always be able to see more-the mountains to the north, the hint of plains creeping between the hills to the east, 
				the threat of swampy waters hoarding the west. We have always taken note of this but often left it alone as villagers 
				are happy where they call home. Endermen, in contrast, can travel, and thus their home lies in those views. Their world-view is entirely 
				seperate from ours, and yet Me remains our friend, often visiting the village despite the wonders well outside its boundaries. 
				Through our discussions and adventures documenting Steve's build journeys, Me has picked up quite a deal 
				about their own architectural process!</p>
			<p> Thus, let this page be a place housing the explorations of Me as a builder
				rather than an observer. Here, we'll break down Me's designs, explaining the elements they wanted to include,
				the reasons behind them, and their connections to the "real world" architectural elements we have documented based 
				on Steve's talks with our wandering friend and the unique elements Me has found while taking notes of Steve's 
				abandoned projects.The housing of Me's builds will be logged by creation, able to be searched for in case the other builders in Steve's 
				world may like to comment or follow Me's experience improving their design style. We'll also provide access to the floor plans,
				images representing the "hopeful" outcome of Me's visions for the projects, and their direct conversions to Minecraft blocks and associated color pallets.

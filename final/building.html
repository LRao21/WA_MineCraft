			<h1> Build With Me!</h1>
			<div>
				<h3>The Eyes Move The Hands</h3>
				<p> No matter what angle you look at in our village, you'll always be able to see more -- the mountains to the north, the hint of plains creeping between the hills to the east, 
					the threat of swampy waters hoarding the west. We have always taken note of this but often left it alone as villagers 
					are happy where they call home. Endermen, in contrast, can travel, and thus their home lies in those views. Their world-view is entirely 
					seperate from ours, and yet Me remains our friend, often visiting the village despite the wonders well outside its boundaries. 
					If anything, Me has inspired us to wonder about that world outside, despite our better judgement. Thus, we await Me's 
					reports of Steve, whether it be intriguing elements of Steve's projects or just the ordinary things about the world Me enjoys. 
				</p>	
				<p>As of late, Me's reports have bombarded us with a new type of anticipation: ideas of their own. Sometimes its the occassional 
					mention of a take on Steve's decorations. Sometimes its a suggestion for their color palet. Sometimes, it just thoughts of their own.
					Regardless of the source, it has become evident that Me's world now lies in a new dimension: a passion for creation! As their friends, 
					it would be wrong of us to let that passion falter.
				</p>
				<p> Thus, let this page be a place housing the explorations of Me as a builder
					rather than an observer. Here, we'll break down Me's designs, explaining the elements they wanted to include,
					the reasons behind them, and their connections to the "real world" architectural elements we have documented based 
					on Steve's talks with our wandering friend and the unique elements Me has found while taking notes of Steve's 
					abandoned projects.The housing of Me's builds will be logged by creation, able to be searched for in case the other builders in Steve's 
					world may like to comment or follow Me's experience improving their design style. We'll also provide access to the floor plans,
					images representing the "hopeful" outcome of Me's visions for the projects, and their direct conversions to Minecraft blocks and associated color pallets.
				</p>
				<p>
					Before you explore, we would like to draw your attention first to an example of what this page will grow to be: Me's first house! 
					After a rather clear morning, Me appeared in the village as usual, but with a new expression on their otherwise empty face. It is then, for the very first time,
					they asked Jeffrey for a quill and paper. To our amazement, they drew furiously. When they finished, we found ourselves in front of a pile of pages slashed in ink with 
					notes, roof designs, balcony designs, doors, woods--all ultimately collaging into an unusual looking building. Me called it a home, inspired 
					by Jeffrey's library, a recent project of Steve, and the color of pink wood. (Pink! We know! Who knew there existed cherry wood in such a peaceful world?)
					Thus, Me's very first log documents their very first explosion of creativity: a pink, two story home in a leveled place a bit away from th village as not
					to disturb the peace of the village's norm. Take a look!

				<h3>At The End of The Last Spark</h3>
				<p> For all Me has scribbled, and yet it appears you have exhausted every blot. We hope 
					that means you found use or thrill with Me's designs and our break down of its elements,
					whether that be an deep-dive into the roof structure or a brief rant into the peculiarity of 
					carpet shapes. As of now, Me is off on their next adventure. When they return, they may add 
					new logs to this page, giving space for the newest elements piquing their interests. (Shawn 
					hopes it is something red this time, but that is debatable.) This page came to be because one 
					day cherry wood captivated Me's adventures. Now, this page stands on Me's outlook for new, 
					captivating features of the places they call home. Until the world turns grey or Steve leads, that 
					search will continue, creating a slightly different world block by block. As our friend has made this,
					we suggest it'll be a nicer world, not just a different one.

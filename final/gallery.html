			<h2>Oh, To Stumble Upon Memories with a Handful of Pencils!</h2>

			<p>As much as we can discuss details,<a href = "#groupings">visuals</a>are key to understanding crossroads. 
				In addition to inspiring us to search for more in our beautiful world, they also help 
				us share that beauty and intrigue with you.
				Thus, part of our exploration will be visual through the gallery.</p>

			<p>Although not encompassing all the elements that 
				make up the crossroads, their intent still lies in capturing the moments that make a 
				crossroad meaningful at a personal level. In that spirit, most--if not all--of the gallery 
				is hand-drawn, giving a “shout-out” to how planning can ultimately affect final build 
				results. The items you find scattered across our four groupings are representative of some of our experiences and 
				design processes--wwhether that be snippets from following a <a href = "https://archive.org/details/MCCSNHandbook/page/n11/mode/2up" target = "_blank">tutorial</a>, to mistakes in our 
				own designs, to<a href = "gallerySteve.html">the works of Steve</a> that inspired us before making those mistakes.</p>
			
				<p> They also represent elements of<a href = "galleryInt.html">curiosity.</a> For example:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How do you plan for interior space if Minecraft characters can't act as though they “live” in homes besides sleeping? </li>
					<li>What might the furniture look like?</li>
					<li>What do players have to overlook to make the place feel more lifelike?</li>
				</ul>
			<p>The purpose of this page is reflection and memory. 
				We hope with each image you bring your own curiosity as well, and ultimately get a 
				better idea of what inspired MineCraft Crossroads in the first place.

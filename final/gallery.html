			<h3>Oh, To Stumble Upon Memories with a Handful of Pencils!</h3>
			<p>As much as we can discuss details, visuals are key to understanding crossroads. 
				Minecraft's many builds and our everyday architecture would lose a layer of meaning if 
				users could not enjoy them in sight and presence. Given this, part of our exploration 
				will be visual through the gallery. Although not encompassing all the elements that 
				make up the crossroads, their intent still lies in capturing the moments that make a 
				crossroad meaningful at a personal level. In that spirit, most-if not all-of the gallery 
				is hand-drawn, giving a “shout-out” to how planning can ultimately affect final build 
				results. The items you find below are representative of some of our experiences and 
				design processes, whether that be snippets from following a tutorial, to mistakes in our 
				own designs, and the works of others that inspired us before making those mistakes. 
				They also represent elements of curiosity. For example, how do you plan for interior 
				space if Minecraft characters can't act as though they “live” in homes besides sleeping? 
				What might the furniture look like? What do players just have to go with to make the 
				place feel more lifelike? The purpose of this page is reflection and memory. 
				We hope with each image you bring your own curiosity as well, and ultimately get a 
				better idea of what inspired MineCraft Crossroads in the first place.

					<h3>Minecraft provides the opportunity to recreate one's perspective...</h3>
					<p> 
						... whether that be by <a href = "building.html">creating builds they previously only imagined</a>, by exploring the world and 
						understanding the unfamiliar they see, or by experimenting and learning from the things they 
						believed they knew well moments before. 
						<br><br>
						For us at <a href="about.html">Minecraft CrossRoads</a>, Minecraft recreated our familiar through the stories of our 
						friends--whether that be through the occassional talks of new biome features or adventures following 
						Steve and their many projects. Our world view is constantly evolving, and Minecraft CrossRoads is a 
						testament of that. 
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class = "introduction" id = "questions">
					<h3>Particularly, we're asking more questions about what our world view could be!</h3>
					<p>For Example:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>What then makes up a creator's process? </li>
						<li>How do creators go about developing their builds from idea to finished pieces?</li>
						<li>How do they account for errors in planning they may not have thought of?</li>
						<li>How can we learn from them?</li>
					</ul>
						
				</div>
				<div class = "introduction" id = "golden_message">
					<h3>Minecraft Crossroads wants to explore those questions...</h3>
					<p> ...and analyze the “Minecraft architect” as we understand it. 
						In our pages, you'll find <a href = "building.html">our explorations of example builds</a>, <a href = "galleryExt.html">analysis of architectural elements 
						and their Minecraft counterparts</a>, <a href = "gallerySteve.html">pictoral documentation of our interactions and learnings from our world</a>, 
						and much more! We also are working on <a href = "3D.html">an experimental feature:</a>one where you could play with floorplan ideas at a basic level,
						letting you decide in advance how your visions might look without the need to bust out a book and quill.
						<br><br>
						The ultimate goal of our exploration is sharing our findings with you. We want to get you questioning as we do,
						whether that be through questions extending our own or questions exploring topics we have yet to think of. Regardless,
						these pages are meant to house a subjective exploration. We hope it makes you feel as welcome as we do.

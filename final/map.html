				<h3>Structure: Animal Pen </h3>
				<p>Biome: Plains <br>
				Description: 5 by 6 block area of grass enclosed by oak wood fence. <br>
				Purpose: House/Capture docile mobs such as pigs, sheeps, and cows. <br>
				Jeffrey's Taste: 3/10, <i class="fa-solid fa-receipt"></i>; <br> The space is taken up without 
				frequent use. Shawn also does not like it. As a villager, I am indifferent,
				but as their friend I am not.</p>

				<h3>Structure: Large House </h3>
				<p>Biome: Plains <br>
					Description: 5 by 9 block, 2-story home made with oak wood, cobblestone, and glass. <br>
					Purpose: (Unspecialized) Housing for villagers. <br>
					Jeffrey's Taste: 7/10 <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>; <br> The space at a glance is similar to mine.
					The two-story structure provides ample space, in my opinion. The structure overall is not
					an eyesore. The villagers living there are also pleasant. It could, however, have benefited
					from a balcony. </p>

				<h3>Structure: Temple </h3>
				<p>Biome: Plains <br>
					Description: 3-story home made with a bordered open roof using cobblestone, and glass. <br>
					Purpose: (Unspecialized) Place of Worship for villagers. <br>
					Jeffrey's Taste: 9/10 <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open-reader"></i>; <br> The space at a glance is similar to mine.
					The three-story structure provides ample space for one to find peace with themselves in silence, in my opinion. Although
					it could benefit from more decoration, its simplistic style and purpose as a place of congregration snd community
					outweights its asthetic simplicity. Personally, I have never had an issue.

				<h3>Structure: Pathways</h3>
				<p>Biome: Plains <br>
					Description: Rough pathways throughout the village made with padded dirt. <br>
					Purpose: Navigation throughout the village. <br>
					Jeffrey's Taste: 2/10 <i class="fa-solid fa-book-skull"></i>; <br> The pathways 
					came to be because we all walked there. There is no sense of unity to them. I hear other places
					have actual roads. The village would not be at a loss if they were to humor implementing
					those hearings here. </p>

					Purpose: (Specialized) Housing for Jeffrey, Storage for Village Knowledge <br>
					Jeffrey's Taste: 10/10 <i class="fa-solid fa-book-atlas"></i>; <br> It is my home, after all. </p>

				<h3>Structure: Armorer's Home </h3>
				<p>Biome: Plains <br>
					Description: 6 by 7 block, single story building made with brick, oak wood, and cobblestone. <br>
					Purpose: (Specialized) Provide furnished armor and tools to those willing to trade for them. <br>
					Jeffrey's Taste: 7/10 <i class="fa-solid fa-book-open"></i>; <br> The fellow who works 
					there is rather pleasant. Although the place is rather noisy, it seems of sound foundation. Their tools
					are useful as well. </p>

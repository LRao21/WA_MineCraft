<h4>Group 2: Exploring Interior Design Choices and Experiences of Our Own</h4>
			<p>As much as one can be in awe of the beauty of a build's exterior design, its hosting of 
				a suitable interior is what really makes a build stand out. The “Exploring Interior 
				Design Choices and Experiences of Our Own” group involves some memorable experiences of 
				the team when they tried to make “beautiful” builds and realized they needed to make an 
				interior for their shell. To elaborate, the first image is from one of our 
				first experiences with “furniture” in the game years ago: the blacksmith's table. 
				For us, it's an example of a simple interior that gave the room personality without 
				needing to be filled with mods to make it more usable. One could run with it as is and
				still enjoy the structure's role in the game. The second and third images are drawings 
				of interiors from our builds. The second is a kitchen we replicated out of inspiration 
				from another creator, highlighting the role of community inspiration and creativity in 
				making elaborate yet simple interiors. The third shows the opposite, an example of a 
				mistake made when planning, leaving us with a rather empty room lacking a true idea of 
				what it could have been. Combined, these images represent the results of deploying 
				planning and creativity into builds, giving way for satisfying results.

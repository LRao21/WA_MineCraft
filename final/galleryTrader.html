                    <p> In addition to our own adventures, our collection would be incomplete without the contributions of our dear friend,
                        the Wandering Villager. The <em>“Trades From Our Discussions With The Wandering Trader”</em> group involves snippets of 
                        interesting items the trader showed us during our long talks. </p>
                    <p> To ellaborate, these snippets, from the trader's vast options of items,
                        are those that Me was excited to see or Jeffrey thought was a beautiful addition to their library. Importantly,
                        they all told us much about the worlds they came from, often biomes far away for the entire team to travel.
                        Those snippets, are a Lily Pad, a pink Tulip, and pumpkin seeds. Although miniscule in the grand scheme of things,
                        they tell us about the swamps in the distance that Me cannot reach because of the water, the quiet fields where the flowers bloom and the mountains 
                        other varieties whisper in, and the variety of foods other villages prouce different from our carrots, beets, and potatoes.

                        <p>Me found this item interesting as it was completely unfamiliar. We suspect that was because 
                            endermen cannot touch water without being harmed. Given that lily pads are usually found in the swamp 
                            biome, Me would not have seen it before. We intend to add it to a small pool in one of our 
                            build's accessory pool of water.

                        <p>Our village happens to be in a location without many flowers. Me has made clear, however,
                            that flowers do exist just beyond the mountains around us. This tulip were serve as a pretty reminder of that.
                            We intend to add it to our village instead of another build in the hopes more arrive soon enough to add 
                            some more color to our otherwise green fields.

                        <p>Me just thought the pumpkin seeds looked nice. We are excited to try it for the first time 
                            whenever it grows to full size. Apparently, they are deep orange! Hopefully, they do not taste like carrots.

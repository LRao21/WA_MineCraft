		<h1> About Us</h1>
		<h3>What is MineCraft CrossRoads? </h3>
		<p></p>
		<h3>What We Know About Steve</h3>
		<p>Based on the Wandering Trader that visits the village every couple of weeks, Steve appears to be one of 
			his clients. After many lengthy discussions over the worth of bamboo sticks, the Trader mentioned 
			this strange being. We consider them strange for the Trader made it clear that many of their features
			resembled ours yet did not at the same time.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Who Runs MineCraft Crossroads?</h3>
		<p>MineCraft Crossroads is run by a team of three members of our world (the "server" as Steve calls it.)
			Our members met at our founder's village through inivitations from them, joining the team 
			part-time and contributing to its development through their unique experiences with architecture
			in the different parts of the world, also keeping a lookout for the infamous "Steve."
		</p>

				<p>Hi There! I'm <em><strong>Me</strong></em>. I have been on the server since its existence. Originally, I spent
					most of my time in the End, but then I became friends with Jeffrey after he left me take
					one of the books from his collection! Jeffrey invited me to join his MineCraft Crossroads group.
					I don't really know what's going all all the time, but I am the member with moving arms, so I 
					handle our visual components and images. I am also our main content creator when I am not in the End.

				<p>Hi There! I'm <em><strong>Shawn</strong></em>. I haven't-MOOOO-been around too long, but I enjoy the grass on the server! Nice pick
					by whoever made this-MOOOO-world. I met Me a while back after they took one of the fences in my enclosure,
					MOOOO-letting me escape the village I was in and explore the world! Jeffrey offered me wheat-MOOOO-to come back
					to the village, but this time as a member of MineCraft Crossroads-MOOOO-team. I handle our reviews page
					with the help of Me as I do not have hands.

				<p>Hi There! I'm <em><strong>Jeffrey</strong></em>. I have been on the server since my village was here. I founded MineCraft Crossroads
					aftering buying books with the local wandering villager and learning so much about the rest of the world. Even more 
					surprising was a book he gave me about stories from "Steve" speaking of the "real world".
					Every week since, I compare notes with the wandering villager, learning more about Steve's world and our own,
					taking advantage of the many books on architecture I have in my library. It used to be a passion of mine before I was 
					a librarian.

			deliver it to us. <br>
			Alternatively: Reach out to us via the "Linkedin", as we have learned of through Steve.

			<h3>Oh, To Stumble Upon Memories with a Handful of Pencils!</h3>
			<p>As much as we can discuss details, visuals are key to understanding crossroads. 
				Minecraft's many builds and our everyday architecture would lose a layer of meaning if 
				users could not enjoy them in sight and presence. Given this, part of our exploration 
				will be visual through the gallery. Although not encompassing all the elements that 
				make up the crossroads, their intent still lies in capturing the moments that make a 
				crossroad meaningful at a personal level. In that spirit, most-if not all-of the gallery 
				is hand-drawn, giving a “shout-out” to how planning can ultimately affect final build 
				results. The items you find below are representative of some of our experiences and 
				design processes, whether that be snippets from following a tutorial, to mistakes in our 
				own designs, and the works of others that inspired us before making those mistakes. 
				They also represent elements of curiosity. For example, how do you plan for interior 
				space if Minecraft characters can't act as though they “live” in homes besides sleeping? 
				What might the furniture look like? What do players just have to go with to make the 
				place feel more lifelike? The purpose of this page is reflection and memory. 
				We hope with each image you bring your own curiosity as well, and ultimately get a 
				better idea of what inspired MineCraft Crossroads in the first place.

			<h4>Group 1: Exploring Exterior Design Elements in Popular Minecraft Builds</h4>
			<p>The “Exploring Exterior Design Elements” group involves snippets from experiences 
				designing the exteriors of builds. Particularly, they focus on specific design elements, 
				such as window and roof design, instead of the larger scale of builds. Details lie in 
				thought, and that is something we wish to explore through crossroads. To elaborate, 
				the current snippets are drawing of the roof from the “Wooden House” from the Minecraft 
				Handbooks (in comparison to the Pitched Roof style in reality), the window design from 
				the mountainous palace built by FyreUK (in comparison to the window designs and opening 
				styles in reality), and an outline of one of our team member's favorite village 
				structures: the Desert Biome Blacksmith House. Combined, these images represent design 
				choices others—players and Mojang alike—made in world planning, highlighting the 
				significance of small decisions in overall builds. 
			</p>
			<h4>Group 2: Exploring Interior Design Choices and Experiences of Our Own</h4>
			<p>As much as one can be in awe of the beauty of a build's exterior design, its hosting of 
				a suitable interior is what really makes a build stand out. The “Exploring Interior 
				Design Choices and Experiences of Our Own” group involves some memorable experiences of 
				the team when they tried to make “beautiful” builds and realized they needed to make an 
				interior for their shell. To elaborate, the first image is from one of our 
				first experiences with “furniture” in the game years ago: the blacksmith's table. 
				For us, it's an example of a simple interior that gave the room personality without 
				needing to be filled with mods to make it more usable. One could run with it as is and
				still enjoy the structure's role in the game. The second and third images are drawings 
				of interiors from our builds. The second is a kitchen we replicated out of inspiration 
				from another creator, highlighting the role of community inspiration and creativity in 
				making elaborate yet simple interiors. The third shows the opposite, an example of a 
				mistake made when planning, leaving us with a rather empty room lacking a true idea of 
				what it could have been. Combined, these images represent the results of deploying 
				planning and creativity into builds, giving way for satisfying results.

			<h3>Tales From The Adventures of Me and the Wandering Trader!</h3>
			<h4>Group 3: Exploring Remnants of Interactions With Steve</h4>
			<p>The “Exploring Remnants of Interactions With Steve” group involves snippets from Me's experiences 
				tracking Steve, learning about their build style and how to incorporate liked elements of their 
				work into their own. Particularly, they focus on peculiar elements in Steve's most recent lodging (and thus Me's most recent expedition.) 
				To ellaborate, the current snippets are drawings of a corner of Steve's home where we believe they kept supplies,
				another corner with what we have found to have been referred to as a "closet", and of a nearby tower that may have
				been used to scout out dangers from afar. Me chose these specific snippets because the items in them-the "carpet", "armor stand",
				and the grand height of the tower-are unfamilar. Most of the crafts in this world are of much shorter height unless a mountain,
				and most of the blocks in them are not designed to hold clothing or cover the floors. Yet, Steve knows of them, and Me 
				plans to experiment with them in future builds.
			<h4>Group 4: Trades From Our Discussions With The Wandering Trader</h4>
			<p>In addition to our own adventures, our collection would be incomplete without the contributions of our dear friend,
				the Wandering Villager. The “Trades From Our Discussions With The Wandering Trader” group involves snippets of 
				interesting items the trader showed us during our long talks. To ellaborate, these snippets, from the trader's vast options of items,
				are those that Me was excited to see or Jeffrey thought was a beautiful addition to their library. Importantly,
				they all told us much about the worlds they came from, often biomes far away for the entire team to travel.
				Those snippets, are a Lily Pad, a pink Tulip, and pumpkin seeds. Although miniscule in the grand scheme of things,
				they tell us about the swamps in the distance that Me cannot reach because of the water, the quiet fields where the flowers bloom and the mountains 
				other varieties whisper in, and the variety of foods other villages prouce different from our carrots, beets, and potatoes.

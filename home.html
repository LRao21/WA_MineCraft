			<h1 class="primary-statement">Crossroads of Minecraft and Architecture</h1>
			<p class="secondary-statement">Explore and experiment with some of the architectural 
				elements and considerations in real-life designs that cross into the architecture of Minecraft builds, 
				as well as the ones in Minecraft that don't. Two paths, so many crossroads! </p>

			<p>When we started playing Minecraft, we were dazzled by the worlds people had made. 
				They were amazing because someone imagined them in every detail and brought them to life for others to enjoy, 
				much like how architects design the public and private infrastructure of our world to be shared with our communities.</p> 
			<p>However, unlike our world, Minecraft boasts creation without as many physical constraints. 
				What then makes up a creator's process? How do creators dazzle like those in our world? 
				Minecraft Crossroads wants to explore that difference and analyze the “Minecraft architect.” 
				In our pages, you'll find our explorations of example builds, analysis of real-life architectural elements 
				and their Minecraft counterparts, resources to connect explorations with their online roots, 
				and much more! We also have a place to experiment on your own to expand our explorations, 
				giving a unique space to mess with your inner architect as we do ours. </p>
